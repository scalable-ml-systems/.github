# Scalable ML Systems

## Real-world AI infrastructure and MLOps systems for modern ML workloads.

Building real-world AI infrastructure for the next generation of machine learning systems.

This organization is a collection of architected, end-to-end projects covering:

- Reproducible ML pipelines
- Data engineering + versioning
- Training automation
- Experiment tracking + registry
- CI/CD for ML
- GPU-accelerated training platforms
- Triton/KServe inference systems
- Kubernetes + Terraform infrastructure
- Observability, logging, monitoring
- Cost governance + scaling strategies

Built with a “production-first” mindset, mirroring how modern AI/ML engineering teams operate at scale.

A complete portfolio of real-world MLOps and AI Infra engineering.
