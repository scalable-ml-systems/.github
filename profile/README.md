## Scalable ML Systems
Practical ML infrastructure patterns, documented through real problems and solutions.

- GPU serving inefficiency → Triton with multi‑framework support and GPU scheduling  
- No observability → Prometheus/Grafana/Loki integrated  
- Prototype → production gap → Terraform IaC + CI/CD + service mesh rollout  
- LLM latency/cost → vLLM router with batching and monitoring (in progress)
- Agent workflows → LangGraph + Temporal (in progress)  
- Versioning/reproducibility → DVC + MLflow (in progress)
