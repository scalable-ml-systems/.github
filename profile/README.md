# 🚀 AI Platform Engineering & Agentic Infrastructure

**Architecting the "Paved Roads" for Production-Grade AI.** This organization is a masterclass in **Cloud-Native AI Systems**, focused on bridging the gap between raw compute (GPUs) and autonomous agentic workflows.

## 🌐 The Portfolio Philosophy
Each repository here is a **production-ready blueprint**, not just a script. I focus on:
* **Agentic Orchestration:** Building stateful, self-healing agent runtimes.
* **High-Performance Serving:** Optimizing VRAM and throughput for 400B+ parameter models.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Multi-cloud environments that spin up/down to control burn rates (**FinOps**).
* **Observability:** Deep-stack monitoring from CUDA kernels to API latency.

## 🛠️ The Core Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure** | AWS · GCP · Terraform · **Kubernetes (EKS/GKE)** · VPC Networking |
| **Agentic Ops** | **LangGraph** · Temporal · Redis (Stateful Memory) · MCP |
| **Inference & Serving** | **vLLM** · Triton Inference Server · TensorRT-LLM · FastAPI |
| **ML Platforms** | Kubeflow · MLflow · Ray (Distributed Training) · Prefect |
| **Reliability/FinOps** | Prometheus · Grafana · GitHub Actions (CI/CD) · Cost-Optimized Spot Instances |

## 📂 Key Architectures
* **[Agent-Orchestration-Platform]:** A stateful, Redis-backed runtime for autonomous agents using LangGraph.
* **[Scalable-Inference-Cluster]:** Auto-scaling vLLM deployment on EKS with custom GPU monitoring.
* **[End-to-End-MLOps-Pipeline]:** Data versioning with DVC and automated retraining triggers via Prefect.

### 💼 Career Trajectory
I am building toward **Solutions Architecture** and **AI Platform Lead** roles. I believe the future of engineering isn't just writing code—it's managing the **infrastructure of intelligence.**
