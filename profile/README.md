# Scalable ML Systems

**Mission:** Build open-source infrastructure that makes production AI deployment 
cost-efficient, reliable, and scalable.

## The Problem
Companies deploying LLMs face:
- 60%+ wasted GPU spend from inefficient serving
- Lack of production-grade observability
- No clear path from prototype to production
- Expensive, complex infrastructure

## Our Solution
Production-ready platforms for:

### GPU Inference Platform Using Nvidia Triton 
- Multi-framework support (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- Production security (IAM, RBAC, network policies)
- Full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions)
- Service Mesh for routing and canary deployments
- High availability architecture
- GPU optimization
- Scalable design

### LLM Inference Platform
Cost-optimized serving with intelligent routing
- 60% cost reduction vs naive deployment
- Sub-100ms latency at scale
- Built on vLLM with full observability

### Agentic Orchestration Platform  
Stateful, reliable agent workflows
- LangGraph + Temporal integration
- Redis-backed state management
- Production monitoring

### MLOps Infrastructure
End-to-end versioning and reproducibility
- DVC + MLflow integration
- Automated retraining triggers
- Compliance-ready audit trails
